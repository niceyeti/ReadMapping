Contains a read-mapping implementation using a SuffixTree construction and sequence alignment.

The SuffixTree and sequence alignment code are both from previous class projects, so if any 
of this code is to be used again, its in good reliable shape, but could be cleaned up significantly.

See Prg3Spec.txt for full algorithmic and implentation details.
